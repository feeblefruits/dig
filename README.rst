PROJECT DIG
=========================
The project is a data visual storytelling microsite for the Mail & Guardian. The live site can be found
[here](https://silicosis.mg.co.za).

Motivation
-----------------
The main motivation for the project was to implement effective scrollytelling and a 3D map using mapbox.

Application setup
-----------------

In terminal or command line:

  cd to your local/dir/dig

  python -m http.server 8000-

Site overview
-----------------

The site consists of three main elements namely:

- the body which includes the text content, graphics, etc.
- the transition galleries, which are hosted on github.io
- the scrollytelling map

The map was inspired by Matt Daniels who did The Pudding's [Population Mountains](https://pudding.cool/2018/12/3d-cities-story/).

The transition gallery was done mostly looking to [Cody House](https://codyhouse.co/gem/page-scroll-effects) and implementing videos.
