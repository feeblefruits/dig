        <span class="firstcharacter">B</span>uilding South Africa’s biggest class action
        lawsuit comes with a unique set of challenges. In 2012, Richard Spoor Inc. requested the class
        certification of more than 15,000 prospective class members at the South Gauteng High Court.
        After years of proceedings, the court handed down its judgement in 2016. Among one of the rulings
        were the need to examine individual cases of each miner. This was unprecedented.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Legal representatives of South Africa's biggest case, namely Richard Spoor Inc.,
        Abrahams Kiewitz Attorneys and the Legal Resources Centre, now needed to determine whether
        each represented mineworker has in fact been affected by silicosis and tuberculosis.
        Various documents were needed from each represented case such as their identity documents,
        medical records and employment history.</p>
      <p class="para">
        The legal team then had to build a database -- one to locate, verify
        and ultimately compensate the miners. Not only did this require sourcing hundreds of
        thousands of physical documents from various different forums, associations and employers,
        many of those former mineworkers live in rural parts of neighbouring countries.
        They worked in the mines decades ago. Others have already passed away.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        “We needed to find clients for the class action,”
        explains George Khan from Richard Spoor Inc.
        By collecting workers’ data the team managed to build a wealth of knowledge of over
        50,000 potential claimants which is growing larger by the day.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Khan says that it’s a common tactic in the legal
        industry for corporate attorneys to overwhelm legal firms who are building a
        case against them with information. These days, however, firms can accommodate physical,
        unstructured information.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        “It’s no longer an effective strategy to dump tons of boxes of documentation
        on us with the hope that we’re going away. That’s probably the last thing they want to do now,” says Khan.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Sourcing this information was not their biggest concern though.
        The team still had to analyse the data and make sense of it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p class="para">
        Ken Gliddon from Cape Town assisted with building this database.
        He says they receive as much as 25 boxes of workers’ records every day.
        Each box contains copies of around 70 former mineworkers documentation.
        These include identity documents, medical records, employment history and other
        so-called unstructured data about the potential claimants.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        "What we're trying to do there is to tie all those bits together.
        Some of it's meaningless, some are particularly relevant like payslips and ID documents," says Gliddon.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Using computer vision, the model he built can quickly rivel
        through that information and extract all the data. What they end up
        with is a dataset that is searchable because that the files have been
        converted into machine text as opposed to just an image. "We can now search
        these hundreds of documents for the word 'death', for example, and extract only
        those relevant files -- many of which refer to death certificates."
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Gliddon and his team at Spotonline is the technical partner of the legal
        firms who represented the miners. The team has so far digitised hundreds of
        thousands of handwritten doctor’s notes, service history records, identification
        documents, death certificates and current addresses required to build the case and ultimately inform the trust.

    </div>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p class="para">
        Khan says that it would’ve cost us a small fortune to employee
        an army of paralegals who would’ve taken years to produce the same results manually.
        The technology enables legal firms who normally wouldn't be able to afford or
        have the capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data to now take on big corporations.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        “By having machines that can do that on mass,
        it’s very easy to quickly work out who can and who can’t qualify just based on service,”
        explains Gliddon. In terms of classification, the model uses a machine learning algorithm
        that determines the amount of evidence each claimant has on record to support their claim for compensation.
        This is critical in helping them prioritise specific claims. Miners' potential claims are categorised by weak,
        moderate and strong, among other groups. Of those categorised, over 1,000 people have strong cases so far.
      </p>
      <p class="para">“The more data the model gets the smarter it gets,” he says.
        They’ve even trained the model to the point where it can differentiate between different
        doctors and specialists by picking up patterns in their diagnosis. By doing this,
        the team can isolate how different doctors read different things.
        “So we can go to that doctor and say to them: ‘You always pick out TB
        where nobody else can see TB. What is it that you’re looking for that nobody else can bloody see?’.”

        <span class="firstcharacter">B</span>y using the database of potential claimants,
        the team is able to find hotspots of clients in certain areas.
        This is essential in tracking down more potential claimants who could otherwise be excluded
        from the litigation and compensatory process.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        “This is critical as far as the compensatory process goes,”
        says Khan "The trustees are going to want to know where they need to go
        look for these people to find them in order to make sure whoever is
        eligible to get money gets paid their money. It also helps us understand
        where other potential claimants are.”
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        The court this year ruled that the claims will be paid over a period of
        12 years managed by the Tshiamiso Trust. R845 million would be used for identifying and locating the claimants.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        However, the real fight starts now, says Vama Jele from the
        Southern Africa Miners Association.
        "I am saying with confidence that both institutions the Health
        Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases and the Tshiamiso
        Trust do not have a turn around time for payment."
