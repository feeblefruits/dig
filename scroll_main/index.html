        <p class="writing">It took more than a century of commissions, investigations, litigations, acts and reports for the industry to agree to compensate gold miners and their dependents who were affected by silicosis and tuberculosis.  But one of the key drivers that has led to the R5-billion compensation agreement have been the advances in machine learning and clever process hacks.<br>
        Today the use of technology have fundamentally changed the way large class action lawsuits are being done. Key tasks that would otherwise have taken years for a group of paralegals to complete can now be processed and analysed in a matter of weeks.</p>

        <p class="writing">Building South Africa’s biggest class action lawsuit comes with a set of unique challenges. One of these challenges was to find potential claimants like Mdluli and Lukhele. The legal team had to build a database to help locate, verify and ultimately compensate the miners -- many of who live in rural parts of neighbouring countries and worked in the mines decades ago. Others have already passed away.

        Ken Gliddon who assisted with this massive task welcomes about 25 boxes of workers’ records every day. Each box contains copies of about 70 former mineworkers documentation. These include identity documents, medical records, employment history and other unstructured information about the potential claimants.

        Gliddon and his team at Spotonline is the technical partner of the legal firms who represented the miners Richard Spoor Inc, Abrahams Kiewitz Inc and the Legal Resources Centre. The information was sourced over the years from numerous mining companies, forums and associations.

        “We needed to find clients for the class action,” explains George Khan from Richard Spoor Inc. By collecting workers’ data the team managed to build a wealth of knowledge of nearly 50,000 potential claimants so far.

        Gliddon, who’s based in Cape Town, explains that his team uses a scanner to digitise the miners’ documents. Optical character recognition -- a computer technique that converts printed and handwritten text into machine-encoded text -- is then employed to extract specific data such as the ID number, address and medical condition of each individual case to create a database that can be analysed.

        Using the database, the team is able to find hotspots of clients in certain areas. This is essential in tracking down more potential claimants who could otherwise be excluded from the litigation and compensatory process.

        “This is critical as far as the compensatory process goes. The trustees are going to want to know where they need to go look for these people to find them in order to make sure whoever is eligible to get money gets paid their money,” says Khan. “It also helps us understand where other potential claimants are.”</p>
